# installer_scripts
Some easily auditable bash scripts for installing software using app specific apt repos.

**Use at your own risk.  These are simple and well commented to encourage you to review them yourself.**

Personally I'm using these individually in [multipass](https://multipass.run/) generated VMs.

1. Apache Airflow
2. Jenkins CI
